# node-red-contrib-opencv-js
Node-Red node for exposing OpenCv functionality in Node-Red

## Install
Run the following npm command in your Node-RED user directory (typically ~/.node-red):
```
npm install node-red-contrib-opencv-js
```
In contradiction to other OpenCv based nodes, there is **NO** need to install OpenCv manually!
Indeed, OpenCv will be installed automatically.  See [here](OPENCV.md) for more technical information about this process.
